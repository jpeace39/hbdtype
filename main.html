  <h2>Raspberry Pi . . .</h2> 

  <p>
    The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. 
    It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python.

  <h2>Sonic Pi . . .</h2>

  <p>
    Sonic Pi is an open source program that allows you to create new sounds in a live coding environment. It is a new musical instrument that is played through the writing of code rather than the stroking of keys or strumming of strings.
